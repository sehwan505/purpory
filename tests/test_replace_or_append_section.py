"""#1688 - purpory's shared-file section update must not destroy user content.

_replace_or_append_section used to locate its marker (`## purpory`) as a
substring, so a bullet or inline reference to the section became the replace
anchor and every line from there to the next heading was deleted. The marker is
now matched only as an exact heading line.
